check_writable is a Nagios plugin that checks if one or more
directories are writable by:

- checking that the supplied directory is indeed a directory
- checking if the the filesystem permissions are OK
- creating a temporary file
- writing random data to the temporary file (and reading it back)

It return a critical status if one of the tests fails
